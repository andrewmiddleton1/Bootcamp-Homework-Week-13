## Installation
To install this application, the user runs the “server.js” file in Node. Running the server file will connect to the MySQL database and prompt the user for a series of questions relating to the creation of their CMS . The employee_tracker DB has been populated with seed data, but requires the user to build the CMS by answering the relevant prompts. , User answers are compiled in MySQL commands which write the new data, update the existing data or delete the data as determined by the user. Various functions are used to combine data from tables depending on which options the user chooses. 

## Usage 
The application requires two main Node packages : inquirer, fs and mySQL. Those packages are used together to prompt the user for information and create the database calls/commands. Connections to the MySQL database we made many times throughout the application, depending on the data required by the user. Step by step instructions can be seen within the attached Screencastify video. https://youtu.be/CW5j4agOJjs.

## Credits
This was a solo project, however the project relied heavily on Node JS and the packages mentioned above. I sought advice from my class instructors, the Ask BCS instructors and would like to thank Renato for his assistance during our Sunday night tutoring sessions.
